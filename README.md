# Tipster
Tipster is a tool for artists to start boosting their income by receiving tips from their fans. It lets artists sign up/login, connect to stripe in order to receive payments and generate qr code. On the fan side users can scan qr code and send tips/personalized notes to their favorite artists which will appear on Artist's dashboard. The app was engineered and designed by me in a week.
